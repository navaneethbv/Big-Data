1. The college cluster wasn't working. So we ran the programs directly in our local(Windows). 
2. To run the program, install the latest version of spark on your file system.
3. Add the C:\spark-1.5.1\bin to your PATH variable in your ENVIRONMENT.
4. Run the following command - spark-shell 
5. Provide the input file path in the code for itemusermat and movies.dat and run the program. Else go to the directory where the input is used. Both the methods work.
6. Observe the output.

For the 2nd question, run the first line of code. Enter the movie ID as the input from the command line. Then run the rest of the code. This is done as we need to take movie id as a command line argument.


EDIT: The scala code was tested on hortonworks VM and it's working.
